Dear Hiring Manager,

<Note: This cover letter was composed using **Vim**, and checked into a local **Git** repository.  Not because it's required, but because it's how I like to do things.>

In other words, I am super excited to apply to the *Analytics Engineer* position with Fishtown Analytics.  As this letter will demonstrate, I work smart, communicate clearly, and care deeply about my work.  These skills along with my honed analytic skills make me an excellent candidate for the position.

I've been working on contract with Comcast Corp. since 03/02/2020, and was just dropped to zero hours due to the novel coronavirus outbreak.  My duties during my short time there included analyzing web traffic data using the Python analysis stack (Jupyter Notebook, Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib), manipulating data on AWS Elasticsearch, and collaborating with stakeholders to gather requirements and sniff out data sources.

At Penn Medicine, I worked primarily with the organ transplant department to deliver data for regulatory reporting, patient care improvement, and research.  Our data was stored two places:  a SQL Server database (Epic Clarity) and a custom Oracle data warehouse.  I typically had to merge data from these two in order to produce reports.  A large portion of my work included working with front-end analysts and clinicians to locate where the clinical chart information landed in the databases.

When I started at Penn, my first major job was refactoring a set of sprawling SQL queries that populate a datamart for transplant.  When I left, I had produced several enterprise dashboards in Microsoft Power BI and SAP Web Intelligence, and took part in several data science initiatives as a feasibility analyst.

I know how to build out the big picture while being focused on the details.  With my analytical skills, clear communication, and addiction to the command line, I believe I would fit in well with your company's culture, and excel as an analytics engineer at Fishtown Analytics.  I look forward to discussing this opportunity at your earliest convenience.

Sincerely,
Peter Martinson
